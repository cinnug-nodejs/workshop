# npm

node modules can be published in a public registry known as the npm (node package manager) registry located at (https://npmjs.org). users can then use the _npm_ command line interface (cli) included with node.js (https://npmjs.org/doc/) to install modules. npm will install all dependent modules as well.

## package.json
package.json plays a special role with npm in that it also contains dependent modules.

```javascript
{ 
  "name" : "foo",
  "dependencies" :
  { "foo" : "1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999"
  , "bar" : ">=1.0.2 <2.1.2"
  , "baz" : ">1.0.2 <=2.3.4"
  , "boo" : "2.0.1"
  , "qux" : "<1.0.0 || >=2.3.1 <2.4.5 || >=2.5.2 <3.0.0"
  , "asd" : "http://asdf.com/asdf.tar.gz"
  , "til" : "~1.2"
  , "elf" : "~1.2.3"
  , "two" : "2.x"
  , "thr" : "3.3.x"
  }
}
```
* Notice that dependencies can specify matching criteria based on semver.
* Dependencies can also point directly to a tarball.

### dev dependencies
package.json can contain dependencies that are only used by developers that are actually developing the module itself. 

```javascript
{
  "name": "foo",
  "dependencies": 
  {
    "foo: "*"
  },
  "devDependenceis":
  {
    "bar": "*"
  }
}
```
* dev dependencies are only installed if the --development switch is passed to npm install or if it is globally configured.

## npm install
installs one or more modules.

one or more module names can be passed at the command line i.e.

```text
npm install express socket.io
```

if no module names are passed, npm will look for package.json to install modules specified in the dependencies.

### common parameters
* --save, -s: update the package.json with any modules that were installed
* -g: install a module globally. 

### global modules
node modules can be global. global modules are command line tools OR modules those tools depend on. 
* On *nix global modules are installed in /usr/local. 
* On windows module are stored under AppData.
* Global modules are never resolved by applications or modules that are not global themselves.

```text
npm install -g express
```

## npm uninstall 
uninstalls a module

## npm ls
lists all modules that were installed for the app.

## npm view <module>
displays details for a module in the main npm registry.

## npm cache
npm maintains a cache of all module that are installed
* add: add a module to the cache
* clean: remove either the specific module or all modules
* ls: list the modules in the cache.
